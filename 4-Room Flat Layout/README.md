# Overview
This is a personal project where I designed and 3D printed my new BTO flat

## Objective
To have a physical model of my new house along with accompanying furniture to play around with the floor design and layout

## Features
- Accurately scaled version of my 4 Room BTO flat
- Miniature furniture scaled proportionately

## Design process
Upon receiving my BTO flat's floor plan, I hopped onto Onshape to model the flat according to the dimensions given. I then scaled them down to fit within my print bed's build volume.

# Future Ideas
1. Create a version with removable walls
