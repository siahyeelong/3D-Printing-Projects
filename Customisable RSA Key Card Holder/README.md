# Overview
This card holder holds a card (customisable thickness) and a RSA key token. It is also customisable, instructions are written in the [Usage](#usage) section

## Background
This is a personal side project I did while interning at HDB as a Data Engineer. On my first day at work, I noticed every staff at HDB had to carry around an RSA key token and a staff pass, and they normally dangle the two on a lanyard with a key ring. I had a passing thought of creating a custom card holder that could neatly hold the two objects on a lanyard.

Luckily, one of the principle data scientists, JJ, had the exact same idea and had 3D printed an RSA token + card holder before. Looking at his design, I thought of enhancing it further by:
1. Making the holder structurally stronger (as it was originally printed vertically, hence having weaker layer adhesion)
1. Making the card holder more aesthetic and customisable
1. Accomodate a different card thickness

## Objective
To create a card holder that holds 1 card and 1 RSA key token, such that it can be attached to a lanyard

## Features
1. Customisable card thickness
1. Customisable name 
1. Customisable logo 

## CAD Model
The card holder was designed on Onshape, and can be found [here](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/cd366e45768ae5cde9782d24/w/6bca1d46e2b0eba1f0af8b46/e/3bb64c4311748994661c816a?configuration=Card_Thickness%3D0.0013000000000000002%2Bmeter%3BFront_Text%3Dyour%2Bname%3BList_3kNECZOv570JrM%3DSOMETHING%3BSide_Text%3Dyour%2Bname&renderMode=0&uiState=671b4d61f3db545e90c4c7af)

# Usage
## 1. Opening the model on Onshape
Open the public model [here](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/cd366e45768ae5cde9782d24/w/6bca1d46e2b0eba1f0af8b46/e/3bb64c4311748994661c816a?configuration=Card_Thickness%3D0.0013000000000000002%2Bmeter%3BFront_Text%3Dyour%2Bname%3BList_3kNECZOv570JrM%3DSOMETHING%3BSide_Text%3Dyour%2Bname&renderMode=0&uiState=671b4d61f3db545e90c4c7af)

## 2. Editing the configurations to suit your needs
On the Configurations panel on the left, edit the configurations according to your needs.

You may choose the available logo options in the dropdown box. 

## 3. Exporting the model
Once you are satisfied with the model, click on the download button on the bottom

Export your model as a .STEP or .stl file to be sliced

## 4. Printing the model
Material: PLA / PETG
Slicer settings:
- Wall loops: 2
- Infill: 10% Lightning
- Supports: None
- Brims: None

## 5. Assembly

# Future Ideas
1. Easier process of choosing and uploading logo to be embedded (currently, I have to search for the svg format of an image, then convert to a dxf format for Onshape to recognise)
