# Overview
This is a modular rugged-style (but not really rugged) parametric latching box that I designed on Onshape. Details on how you can customise your own is listed in [Usage](#usage) 
## Objective
3D printing has its limitations when it comes to structural integrity and tolerances. When using hardware in 3D prints, the tolerances you create in your model may depend on which printer and filament you're using. 

When 3D printing rugged boxes with hinges, I realise that the hinges tend to break easily, rendering the entire box useless. To solve this issue, I have made the parts interacting with hardware replaceable, making it modular for different hole sizes if you wanted to. This hopefully reduces the amount of filament wasted from failed prints.

The hinges and latches snap into place, allowing you to switch it out if you find the tolerances undesirable, or if the hinges break due to accessive use.

## Features
1. Replaceable hinge (snap in place)
1. Replaceable latch (snap in place)
1. Replaceable handle (optional)
1. Customised configurations in CAD Model
## CAD Model
My model can be found on [Onshape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/bd7db400960aa689bd6e2ede/w/8cfd940abfba4c5b97c73ec7/e/d102f4b55f71ee6b03289167?configuration=Bottom_Internal_Height%3D0.08%2Bmeter%3BBox_Internal_Breadth%3D0.112%2Bmeter%3BBox_Internal_Length%3D0.16%2Bmeter%3BHandle%3Dtrue%3BHandle_Length%3D0.1%2Bmeter%3BHandle_Thickness%3D0.015%2Bmeter%3BScrew_Length__stalk_only_%3D0.03%2Bmeter%3BScrew_Size__Diameter_%3D0.004%2Bmeter%3BTop_Internal_Height%3D0.03%2Bmeter%3BWall_Thickness%3D0.003%2Bmeter&renderMode=0&uiState=67186d30c2140f176d8c0c65)

# Usage
## 1. Opening the model on Onshape
Open the public model [here](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/bd7db400960aa689bd6e2ede/w/8cfd940abfba4c5b97c73ec7/e/d102f4b55f71ee6b03289167?configuration=Bottom_Internal_Height%3D0.08%2Bmeter%3BBox_Internal_Breadth%3D0.112%2Bmeter%3BBox_Internal_Length%3D0.16%2Bmeter%3BHandle%3Dtrue%3BHandle_Length%3D0.1%2Bmeter%3BHandle_Thickness%3D0.015%2Bmeter%3BScrew_Length__stalk_only_%3D0.03%2Bmeter%3BScrew_Size__Diameter_%3D0.004%2Bmeter%3BTop_Internal_Height%3D0.03%2Bmeter%3BWall_Thickness%3D0.003%2Bmeter&renderMode=0&uiState=67186d30c2140f176d8c0c65).

## 2. Editing the configurations to suit your needs
## 3. Assembly
# Future Ideas
1. Slimmer hinge options
1. Stackable design
1. Compatible with smaller sizes
1. Customisable number of latches and hinges
