How to Generate a Lithophane:
Use itslitho.com
Upload your picture
Set the dimensions to your liking. For this model, the dimensions were 100x140x3mm
Note that a thicker thickness prints easier as less warping occurs.
Note the print settings I used below, which I highly recommend
Parts Required:
1x lithophane stl file (you have to generate this yourself)
1x main body.stl
1x back panel.stl
2x feet.stl
1x USB-C female plug (or any other if you prefer)
~30cm of 5V LED light strips 2835 (as long as it's 5V it should be fine)
Printing:
main body.stl, back panel.stl, and feet.stl: Use your preferred print settings. 0% infill worked for me on my Ender 3 V1, and it looks nicer without the infill lines. Use Arc Welder to prevent bumps at the curves.
lithophane: Check settings below
Assembly:
Print the main body.stl first to check if the body fits your lithophane.
Assemble the two feet by inserting them through the slot and twisting them 180° to lock them in place and for the correct tilt angle (of 5°).
Assemble the lithophane into the main body.stl by sliding and snapping it in place. It should not be a very tight fit, but once fitted there should be no play.
Check that your USB-C connector fits in the hole in the back panel.stl.
Solder your USB-C connector to the 5V LED strip and test that it works.
Slot in your USB-C and LED strip through the hole and hot glue the USB-C connector in place if required.
Stick the LED strip around the sides of back panel.stl.
Fit the back panel.stl and main body.stl together.
(Optional) Print (as in 2D print) out the generated colored image from itsLitho on paper and stick it to the back of your lithophane for color.

Last but not least, take pictures of your final product and share it here! Let me know if you need me to make a YouTube video to detail out this process. Have fun!
