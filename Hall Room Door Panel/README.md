My university's door has this random transparent acrylic plastic fitted onto every door to put leaflets (i think) and I personally felt that it was a bit too boring. I made this panel to indicate my availability and a QR code for people to contact me if needed. Since I had some extra space, I couldn't think of what to put there so I put a hole there first such that I can design something that can fit onto the panel easily in the future.
