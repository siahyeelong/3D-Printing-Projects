# Overview

My university's door has this random transparent acrylic plastic fitted onto every door to put leaflets (i think) and I just wanted to ✨ spice it up ✨

I made this panel to indicate my availability and a QR code for people to contact me if needed. Since I had some extra space, I couldn't think of what to put, so I designed some slots first. I eventually thought of designing a random bin to give out candy to whoever that walks past
